## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**

A: Not really. The code is already written. You just need to:
1. Upload files to GitHub (drag and drop)
2. Edit text files (find and replace your name)
3. Copy/paste outreach templates

**Q: What if I don't have Customer.io experience?**

A: The demo is simulated - no Customer.io account needed. When you land a client, you can learn as you build (docs are included). Most clients expect you to learn their specific ESP anyway.

**Q: Can I change the case study to a different exchange?**

A: Absolutely! Just edit `docs/case-study-bybit.md` and change "Bybit" to any platform. Keep the structure and metrics similar.

**Q: What if someone asks if Bybit is a real client?**

A: Be honest: "This is a simulated case study for portfolio purposes. I'm available to create similar results for [Their Platform]."

**Q: How long until I land my first client?**

A: Realistically:
- Fast: 2-4 weeks (if you hustle with outreach)
- Average: 4-8 weeks (moderate outreach)
- Slow: 8-12 weeks (passive job board applications)

**Q: What if my demo breaks?**

A: GitHub has version history. Go to repository → Click file → "History" → Revert to working version.

**Q: Can I use this for job applications?**

A: Yes! Hiring managers love seeing actual work. Include:
- GitHub repo link in resume
- Demo link in cover letter
- "Built production email warmup system" in experience section
