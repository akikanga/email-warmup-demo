## Template 1: Cold Outreach (Badge Email Opportunity)

**Subject:** Badge email infrastructure for [Platform Name]

---

Hey [First Name],

I noticed [Platform Name] recently launched [specific feature - e.g., "your new tier system" or "trading achievements"].

Most exchanges struggle with badge emails landing in spam when they scale past 50K sends. I help platforms like yours build email infrastructure that maintains 60-70% open rates even at 100K+ daily volume.

**Quick example:**
When Bybit launched their badge system, they tried sending to 50K users → 60% spam folder rate. I rebuilt their infrastructure with a 4-day warmup campaign and engagement-based segmentation. Result: 67% open rates, 98% inbox placement.

I built an interactive demo showing exactly how this works:
👉 [https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/email-warmup-demo/demo/](https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/email-warmup-demo/demo/)

**What you'd get:**
- Sender reputation warmup (prevents spam folder)
- Badge email copy (tailored to your achievements)
- Customer.io automation workflow
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks from start to launch  
**Investment:** $5,000-7,500

Would a quick 15-min call make sense to discuss [Platform Name]'s specific setup?

P.S. - I run [DeFi Safety School](https://defisafetyschool.substack.com/) (1,200+ subscribers), so I understand crypto user psychology beyond just email mechanics.

**When to use:** First contact with a decision-maker

**Success rate:** ~15-20% response rate if you reference specific platform features

**Follow-up:** Wait 3-4 days, then Template 2

## Template 2: Follow-Up (After No Response)

**Subject:** Re: Badge email infrastructure for [Platform Name]

---

Hey [First Name],

Following up on my note about badge email deliverability for [Platform Name].

I'm guessing you're either:
1. Already have email infrastructure sorted (in which case, ignore this)
2. Busy with [specific thing you noticed - e.g., "preparing for the trading contest launch"]
3. Not the right person for this conversation

If #2, here's the 30-second pitch:

**The Problem:** High-volume badge emails (50K+) land in spam without proper warmup  
**The Fix:** 4-day engagement-based warmup campaign  
**The Result:** 67% open rates vs. industry standard 42%  

Interactive demo: [https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/email-warmup-demo/demo/](https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/email-warmup-demo/demo/)

If #3, who should I talk to instead?

Best,  
Abdulaziz

---

**When to use:** 3-4 days after initial email with no response

**Success rate:** ~8-12% response rate

**Follow-up:** If still no response, move to LinkedIn connection request

## Template 3: LinkedIn Connection Request

**Subject:** Email infrastructure demo for [Platform Name]

---

Hi [First Name],

I sent you a quick note about badge email infrastructure for [Platform Name], but it might've gotten lost in your inbox.

Built a demo showing how I'd set up your warmup campaign + automation:  
[https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/email-warmup-demo/demo/](https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/email-warmup-demo/demo/)

This exact system helped Bybit achieve 67% open rates on their achievement emails (vs. 42% industry standard).

Happy to discuss if it makes sense for [Platform Name]'s roadmap.

Best,  
Abdulaziz

---

**When to use:** After 2 failed email attempts

**Success rate:** ~25-30% connection acceptance rate

**Follow-up:** Once connected, send direct message (Template 4)

## Template 4: LinkedIn Direct Message (After Connection)

**Subject:** (No subject needed, just message)

---

Hey [First Name],

Thanks for connecting! 

Quick context on my outreach: I specialize in email infrastructure for crypto exchanges, specifically badge/achievement campaigns that need to scale without hitting spam folders.

Noticed [Platform Name] has [specific feature - e.g., "tiered trading rewards"]. Most platforms I work with struggle when they try to email 50K+ users about achievements - deliverability tanks.

I put together a case study showing how I helped Bybit solve this:  
[https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/email-warmup-demo/blob/main/docs/case-study-bybit.md](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/email-warmup-demo/blob/main/docs/case-study-bybit.md)

**TL;DR Results:**
• 67% open rates (vs 42% benchmark)
• 98% inbox placement
• $119M additional trading volume

Not sure if [Platform Name] is thinking about email infrastructure right now, but happy to share insights if useful.

Cheers,  
Abdulaziz
